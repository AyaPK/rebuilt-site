## MaGE
**Located at**: [Github](https://github.com/AyaPK/MaGE)

- My university dissertation project, titled Making Gender Transition Easier.
- Provides a secure, obfuscated, app on an Android device with tools to track gender transition goals and medication
- Something very near and dear to my heart, while not currently in active development, MaGE is one of my favourite things that I've ever developed.

![Slack Plays Pokémon preview image](https://img.ayasca.dev/slack-plays-pokemon.png)

- A slack bot allowing users in a Slack server to play Pokémon together, one input at a time, voted democratically with reacts
- Made for use in my company's work Slack, and has since been contributed to by other developers from work.
- This originally started out as something of a joke, but I have a terrible habit of committing to the bit, and eventually made it a reality.
